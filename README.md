## Description

Unconventional superconductivity and anomalous response in hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenides.

## Requirements

- A modern [LaTeX] distribution, e.g., [TeX Live],
  packaged with [XeLaTeX], [Latexmk], and optionally [ChkTeX].
- [GNU Make].
- [Node.js] with [npm].
  Only required when using Bower for external dependencies
  or for autobuilding on changes.
