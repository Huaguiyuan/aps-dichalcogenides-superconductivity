\section{Conclusions}

In this letter, we report on the nature of the superconducting state
of hole doped TMDs.
Remarkably, the valley contrasting phenomena of the parent state
is inherited by the correlated state.
While the magnitude is smaller, the pair breaking leads to quasiparticles
which have the same Berry curvature, and hence the same anomalous velocity.
Thus, one predicts a anomalous hall response similar to
the one observed in in \ce{MoSe2}.
Further consequences of the phenomena will be explored elsewhere.

The spin valley locking also leads to large critical magnetic fields.
A similar phenomena was recently reported in heavily hole-doped
(beyond the spin-split gap) \ce{NbSe2}.
In the new regime, where only one band per valley intersects
the chemical potential, no pair breaking occurs
for in-plane fields unless disorder is present.

While systematic synthesis and characterization of hole-doped systems
is still in its early stages, the fact that other two dimensional compounds
and their bulk counterparts are known to be superconducting
provides impetus to explore the novel phenomena described here.
