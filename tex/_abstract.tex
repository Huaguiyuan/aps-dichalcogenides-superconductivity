Strong spin orbit interaction has the potential to engender unconventional superconducting states. Two dimensional dichalcogenides, MX$_{2}$ where M is a transition metal such as Mo or W, and X is a S or Se, are particularly interesting as the noninteracting electronic states have multiple valleys in the energy dispersion and are topologically nontrivial. We investigate the possible superconducting states of hole doped systems and analyze to what extent the correlated phase inherits the topological aspects of the parent crystal. We find that local attractive interactions and proximal coupling to s-wave superconductors lead to a pairing which is an equal admixture of spin singlet and m=0 spin triplet. The valley contrasting optical response, where oppositely circularly polarized light couple to different valleys, is present even in the superconducting state, but with smaller magnitude. Thus for a given polarization pair breaking results in one quasiparticle in the conduction band in one valley and its partner in the valence band of the other. The locking of spin to momentum also results in unusual response to magnetic field in that no pair breaking occurs for fields in the plane of the crystal in the absence of disorder. As such the critical magnetic fields are quite large compared to conventional superconductors.
