Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides offer a new venue to study the interplay of interaction, spin orbit coupling and topology. in hole doped systems spin degeneracy is lost and the states are externally addressible with spin and valley specificity. This unique structure engenders new possibilties for correlated phases and phenomena. Focussing on superconductivity we show that an unconventional pairing phase is realized which is an equal admixture of a spin singlet and the m=0 spin triplet. The topological content of the superconducting phase allows for generating quasiparticles with net nonzero Berry curvature via pair breaking with circularly polarized light. The phase is also stable against large in-plane magnetic fields.
