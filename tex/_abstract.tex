  Interplay of spin-orbit coupling, interaction,
  and nontrivial valley topology in 2D TMDs
  suggests unconventional correlated phenomena.
  For hole-doped systems, we find:
  BCS pairing arsing from
  local attractive interactions or proximity to $s$-wave superconductors
  equally mixes the spin singlet and $m = 0$ spin triplet;
  the BCS state inherits the valley-coupled circular dichroism;
  and an unusual magnetic response via spin-momentum locking where,
  for in-plane fields, no pair-breaking occurs in the absence of disorder,
  and the critical magnetic fields are larger than conventional superconductors.
