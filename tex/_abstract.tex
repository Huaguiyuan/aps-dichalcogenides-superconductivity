  Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides offer a new venue to study
  the interplay of interaction, spin orbit coupling and topology.
  In hole doped systems spin degeneracy is lost and the states are externally
  addressable with spin and valley specificity.
  This unique structure engenders new possibilities
  for correlated phases and phenomena.
  Focusing on superconductivity we show that an unconventional pairing phase
  is realized which is an equal admixture of
  a spin singlet and the $m = 0$ spin triplet.
  The topological content of the superconducting phase allows for
  generating quasiparticles with net nonzero Berry curvature
  via pair breaking with circularly polarized light.
  The phase is also stable against large in-plane magnetic fields.
