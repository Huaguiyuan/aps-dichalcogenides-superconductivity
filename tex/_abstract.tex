Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides offer a new venue to study the interplay of interaction, spin orbit coupling and topology. For a large window of hole doping spin degeneracy is lost, and the states are externally addressible with spin and valley specificity. This unique structure engenders new possibilties for correlated phases and phenomena. Focussing on superconductivity we show that an unconventional pairing phase is realized which is an equal admixture of a spin singlet and the m=0 spin triplet. The topological content if the superconducting phase allows for generating quasiparticles with net nonzero Berry curvature via pair breaking with circularly polarized light resulting in an anomalous Hall effect. The phase is also shown to be stable against large in-plane magnetic fields.
