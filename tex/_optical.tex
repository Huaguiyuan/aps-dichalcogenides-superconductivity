\section{Optoelectronic coupling}

The non-interacting system displays valley selectivity.
One circular polarization couples to one valley,
and the opposite to the other.
We investigate the extent to which this property
is inherited by the superconducting phase by generalizing
the optical transition rate to the multi-particle interacting system.
Note that one does not expect any dipolar coupling
since the orbitals involved have the same parity.
The optical excitations arise from the Berry curvature,
which acts as an effective angular momentum.
The electromagnetic potential $\vc{A}$,
with polarization vector $\vc{ϵ}$,
is introduced using minimal coupling,
$H_{τ {\s}}^{ν ν'} \ofK
→ H_{τ {\s}}^{ν ν'} \of{\vK + e \vc{A}}$,
where, in the dipole approximation,
$\vc{A} = 2 \re{\vc{ϵ} A_0 e^{- i ω t}}$.
This yields a perturbed Hamiltonian
$H → H + H^A$, where
$H^A = H' e^{- i ω t} + H'^† e^{i ω t}$,
with
\begin{multline}
  H'
  = ∑_{\vK, τ, {\s}}
    H'_τ
    {d^-_{τ {\s}}}^† \ofK
    d^+_{τ {\s}} \ofK \\
  - ∑_{\vK, τ, {\s}}
    H'_{-τ}
    {d^+_{τ {\s}}}^† \ofK
    d^-_{τ {\s}} \ofK,
\end{multline}
and
$H'_τ
= a t e A_0
\left( τ \vc{\hat{x}} + i \vc{\hat{y}} \right) · \vc{ϵ}$.
The transition rate is proportional to the modulus-squared
of the optical matrix elements,
$\vc{P}_{τ {\s}}^{n n'} \ofK$,
defined by
\begin{equation}
  H^A
  = ∑_{\substack{\vK, τ, {\s} \\ n, n'}}
    \frac{e A_0}{m_0}
    \vc{ϵ} · \vc{P}_{τ {\s}}^{n n'} \ofK
    {c_{τ {\s}}^n}^† \ofK
    c_{τ {\s}}^{n'} \ofK.
\end{equation}
For circularly polarized light, in the absence of superconductivity,
$\vc{ϵ}_± = \left( \vc{\hat{x}} ± i \vc{\hat{y}} \right) / \sqrt{2}$ and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:optical}
  \vc{ϵ}_± · \vc{P}_{τ {\s}}^{+ -} \of{\vK}
  = ∓ τ \sqrt{2} a t m_0
    e^{± i ϕ}
    \sin^2 {\frac{\fnTheta{∓ τ}}{2}}.
\end{equation}

The transition rate for optical excitations above the BCS ground state
is given by \cref{eq:optical}
multiplied by a coherence factor $\sin^2 {β_{\vK}}$.
Since $\fnTheta{-} - \fnTheta{+} = τ π$,
switching either the valley or polarization transforms
$\sin → \cos$ in \cref{eq:optical}, giving two unique matrix elements,
$\left| P_± \right| = \left| \vc{ϵ}_± · P_+^{+ -} \sin {β} \right|$,
corresponding to matching ($P_+$) or mismatching ($P_-$)
polarization-valley indexes.

    is chosen for illustrative purposes.

For a given valley, a chosen polarization of light couples more strongly
than the other, as is evident comparing $\abs{P_+}^2$ to $\abs{P_-}^2$
and shown in \cref{fig:optical}.
Thus, the superconducting phase exhibits
the same strong optical-valley coupling for circularly polarized light.
The suppression of the matrix elements above the chemical potential
($λ_{\vK} > 0$)
reflects the fact that the BCS states include the Fermi distribution.
As such, the matrix element is still finite,
but is multiplied by a vanishing occupation probability.
The key new feature is the suppression of the valley contrast
near the chemical potential.
Nevertheless, for energies where the Cooper pair
is broken into quasiparticles well above the gap,
the superconducting state inherits the
valley selective phenomena of the non-interacting system.
